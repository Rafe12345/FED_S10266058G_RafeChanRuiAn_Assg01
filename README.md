## TechYard Website
My idea for assignment 1 is to create my version of the [TechYard](https://thetechyard.com/) website which is an e-commerce platform that sells computer parts

### User goals:
People who are shopping for computer parts would wish to easily navigate the platform so they can find information and products from the website.

### Owner goals: 
The owner wants their platform to be more interactive and accessible so that their products are more visually appealing to users, which could increase sales.

## Design Process
As a user, I would like to find out more information about the company, however, the home page of the official Techyard website clutters your screen with advertisements. Hence, in my version, the first thing users see is information about the company, making it more credible.

As a user, I would like a clean and organised display of all the products, however, the product page of the official Techyard website has too many products in each section making it hard to focus on certain products. Hence, in my version, I would order the products in a clean and organised layout.

## Features
- Filter feature, which allows the users to select checkboxes and only see the products they have selected.

- Add to Cart feature, users can browse products and add them to their cart and then view what they have added on the checkout page which allows them to remove or add items.

- Surprise Promo feature, users can browse the page and get a surprise pop-up notification that rewards them with discounts.

- Drag to scroll feature, instead of pressing buttons to scroll through products, this feature makes it easier to browse products by dragging.

- Back to the top feature, instead of having to scroll back up at the end of the page, this feature allows users to jump back to the top, which improves user experience.

- Responsive design, this feature makes the website accessible to all users on different platforms.

## Technologies Used

### HTML
- Use to create the structure of the website like headings, paragraphs, boxes
### CSS
- Use to make the HTML elements more visually appealing like adding colours and layouts.
### JavaScript
- Use to make the website more interactive through building functions like the surprise promo feature.
